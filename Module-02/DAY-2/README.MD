# Ex.No:2(B) ACCESS MODIFIERS

## AIM:
To develop a Java Program to display the addition number using private modifiers only.

## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the program.
2.	Define a class named `addition`
3.	Declare two private integer variables, `num1` and `num2`
4.	Define a private method `add()` that:
a)	Returns the sum of `num1` and `num2`
5.	Define a public method `display(int n1, int n2)` that:
a)	Assigns `n1` to `num1` and `n2` to `num2`
b)	Calls the `add()` method and prints the result using `System.out.println`
6.	Define the `main` method as static
a)	Create an instance of the `addition` class called `ad`
b)	Call the `display(8, 9)` method on the `ad` object
7.	End
