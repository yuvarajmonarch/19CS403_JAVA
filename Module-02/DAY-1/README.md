# Ex.No:2(A)  STATIC METHOD

## AIM:
To create a java program for calculate cube of a number using static method.

## ALGORITHM :
1.  Start : Begin the process of calculating the cube of a number.
2.	Declare a variable to store input : Declare an integer variable n to hold the number whose cube will be calculated.
3.	Create a Scanner object : Create a Scanner object (sc) to read the input from the user.
4.	Read input from the user : Prompt the user to input an integer value. The input value is stored in the variable n.
5.	Call the cubecal function : Call the function cubecal(n) which computes the cube of the number by performing n * n * n.
6.	Store the result : Store the result of the cubecal function in an integer variable result.
7.	Output the result :
8.	Print the cube of the number using System.out.println("Cube is: " + result);.
9.	End the program.
