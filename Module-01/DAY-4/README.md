# Ex.No:1(D) USER DEFINED METHOD.

## AIM:

To create a Java program print area of rectangle by defining instance method and local variable value as 10,20 .[Class Name is ‘Area’ function name is ‘calculateArea()’ and return type of function is ’void’

## ALGORITHM :

1. Start the program.
2. Define a class named 'Area'
3. Declare a public method named 'calculateArea' with no parameters
4. Inside the 'calculateArea' method:
   a) Declare a Double variable 'length' and assign it the value 10.0
   b) Declare a Double variable 'width' and assign it the value 20.0
   c) Calculate the area by multiplying 'length' and 'width' and store the result in a Double variable 'area'
   d) Print the calculated area using the System.out.println statement
5. Define the 'main' method as static
6. Inside the 'main' method:
   a) Create an instance of the 'Area' class called 'rectangle'
   b) Call the 'calculateArea' method on the 'rectangle' object

        float width = 20;
        float area = length * width;
        System.out.println("Area of Rectangle is " + area);
       }
       public static void main(String[] args)
       {
       Area obj=new Area();
       obj.calculateArea();
       }
}
