# Ex.No:9(E) STRING WRITER

## AIM:

To write a Java program that reads a string from the user and prints it using the StringWriter class.

## ALGORITHM :

a. Start the program.
b. Import java.io.\* and java.util.Scanner.
c. Create a Scanner object to read input from the user.
d. Read a string from the user.
e. Create a StringWriter object.
f. Write the string to the StringWriter object.
g. Convert the StringWriter content to a string using .toString().
h. Print the result on the output screen.
i. Close the writer.
j. End the program.

## PROGRAM:

```
/*
Program to implement a STRING WRITER
Developed by: YUVARAJ B

*/
```

## Sourcecode.java:

```
import java.io.StringWriter;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    String data = "String Writer";

    try {
      StringWriter output = new StringWriter();

      output.write(data);

      System.out.println("Data in the StringWriter: " + output);

      output.close();
    }

    catch(Exception e) {
      e.getStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
```

## RESULT:

Thus, implementation of a Java program was successfully reads a string from the user and uses StringWriter to write and print the string to the output screen.
