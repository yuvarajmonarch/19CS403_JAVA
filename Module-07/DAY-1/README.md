# Ex.No:7(A)           EXCEPTION HANDLING-RUN TIME EXCEPTION
## AIM:
  To Develop a Java Program for handling Arithmetic Exception (division by zero exception) using Exception Handling Mechanism.

## ALGORITHM :
1.  Start the Program
2.	Import `java.util.*` for input handling
3.	Define class `Example1`:
-	a) In `main` method, create `Scanner` object `sc` for input
4.	Use `try` block to:
-	a) Read integers `a` and `b` from user input
-	b) Calculate `res = a / b` and print "Result: " followed by `res`
5.	Use `catch` block to handle `ArithmeticException`:
-	a) If division by zero occurs, print "You Shouldn't divide a number by zero"
6.	End
