# Ex.No:12(D) JAVA QUEUE
## AIM:
To Write a java program to create vector and read the elements for two vector in java collection.(Use equals method )


## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the Program
2.	Import `PriorityQueue` and `Scanner`
3.	Define class `Main` with `main` method:
-	a) Initialize `Scanner` to read input
-	b) Create a `PriorityQueue` of integers
4.	Read integer `n` from user input for the number of elements
5.	Use a loop to:
-	a) Read integers and add them to the `PriorityQueue`
6.	Check if the `PriorityQueue` is not empty:
-	a) Remove and display the highest-priority element using `poll()`
7.	Display the remaining elements in the `PriorityQueue`
8.	End.
