# Ex.No:11(C)             JAVA LINKED HASHMAP
 ## AIM :

To Create a java program to display the contains key of 104 and to retrieve the key and value using linked hash map.

## ALGORITHM :

1.	Start the Program
2.	Import `java.util.*`
3.	Define class `A` with `main` method:
-	a) Initialize `Scanner` and read integer `n`
-	b) Create a `LinkedHashMap` named `hash` to store integer keys and string values
4.	Use a loop to:
-	a) Read an integer and string from the user
-	b) Add the integer as the key and the string as the value in `hash`
5.	Use an enhanced `for` loop to iterate through `hash` and print each key-value pair
6.	Check if the `hash` contains the key `104` and print the result
7.	End
